# üèÆ beacon for velocity
Beacon is a plugin for [Velocity](https://papermc.io/software/velocity) that allows for forced hosts to pass through their pings when using [TCPShield](https://tcpshield.com). This plugin isn't necessary if you're using their [proxy protocol](https://docs.tcpshield.com/commonly-asked-questions#1.-differences-between-our-plugin-vs-proxy-protocol), but it seems to cause issues when proxying a forge server.

## get started
1. Download the latest version of beacon. ([github releases](https://github.com/yyuemii/beacon/releases))
2. Place the beacon plugin jar into the `plugins` folder.
3. Start the proxy!
